TUM XML Lab 2016/17 - Team XForms

------------------------------- TEAM PLAN -------------------------------
-- Please keep this file updated.

Tasks:

1.) TOGI, NICK - Finalize the start screen. Update the texts and content of the start screen. Rename the index.html to startScreen.html. Make sure the start screen is triggered and works on the server. Update the HTML links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

2.) (DONE) ALEXANDROS - Modify the XQuery file "newGame.xquery" to react to clicks on the buttons "PLAY GAME", "NEW GAME" and "PLAY AGAIN" (react to REST calls on the path /gxf/newGame). Make sure the methods work on the BaseX server and move them from "newGame.xquery" to the file "controller.xquery".

2.1) (DONE) JOONAS - After creating a new game instance in the database, call the XSLT transformator "MancalaTransformator" with a web:redirect to the link "http://localhost:8984/gxf/transform/{$gameId}". A new XQuery method has to be created for that in the XQuery file "controller.xquery". The method takes the gameInstance (gameId) as a paramater, applies the transformator to it and returns the resulting XHTML file.

3.) (DONE) TOGI - Modify the XSLT file "MancalaTransformator" to display houses as links. Make sure one can't click on the houses of the opposing player. When clicking on a house trigger the link "http://localhost:8984/gxf/move/{$gameId}/{$houseId}". Add XHTML as the DOCTYPE in the transformator.

3.1.) TOGI - Add CSS styling for the game field (image as background, hover effects etc.).

4.) (DONE) JOONAS - Modify the XQuery file "moveSeeds.xquery" to react to REST calls resulting from clicks on the houses. After distributing the seeds, call a XQuery method to create a web:redirect to the link "http://localhost:8984/gxf/specialCases/{$gameId}/{$startingPit}/{$numOfStepsToMove}/{$player}", which checks the special cases. Add the web:redirect method to the XQuery file "controller.xquery".

5.) TOGI - Merge the XQuery files that check the two special cases into a single XQuery file called "specialCases.xquery". In that file react to the REST call to the link "http://localhost:8984/gxf/specialCases/{$gameId}/{$startingPit}/{$numOfStepsToMove}/{$player}" and check the special cases. After checking, update the database and call a XQuery method that creates a web:redirect to the link "http://localhost:8984/gxf/checkGameOver/{$gameId}". Add the web:redirect method to the XQuery file "controller.xquery". UPDATE: read the comments in GitHub.

6.) LOVRE - Modify the XQuery file that checks if the game is over to react to REST calls to the link "http://localhost:8984/gxf/checkGameOver/{$gameId}". After checking if the game is over, trigger a new web:redirect to the link "http://localhost:8984/gxf/transform/{$gameId}", to apply the XSLT transformator (similarily as in 2.1).

7.) (DONE) ALEXANDROS - Create a new XQuery method called "cleanDatabase". This method should delete all game instances from the file "GameInstanceCollection.xml" that are over.

8.) NICK - Create a new help popup with game instructions that is triggered when clicking on the "HELP" button on the game session screen. This must be implemented in the "MancalaTransformator" file.

9.) NICK - Documentation. Describe our application, workflow, team etc. and add diagrams (You can use the diagrams from the exercises, but make sure they are up to date).
